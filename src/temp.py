And how do you want to evaluate them or their value for The Graph ecosystem?\n3/ On budget. Where will the event be held? And second, at what price will you be ordering t-shirts and stickers?

Also I had a talk with Paka about this workshop and he suggested me to cover concepts like indexing blockchains, subgraphs, substreams.\nThe workshop will consist of sessions covering topics such as how to query and index data on The Graph, creating subgraphs too. I am planning not to dive deeply for now as I want to take the students in a flow and not to freak them out with technical sessions.\n2/ Well there isn’t a specific number, but I plan to invite the students from different universities and I hope the total number would be 100-150 students. We believe that everyone can bring value to the Graph ecosystem, and our goal is to create an inclusive and diverse community. We will evaluate attendees based on their engagement during the workshop, feedback, and their interest in future events and participation in The Graph ecosystem.\n3/ . Firstly 3000$ includes not only the Rent BUT food for the attendees too. For the venue, this time instead of university a space would be looked out and rented so the event isn’t restricted to a single university students. The venue in a central location accessible to attendees will be rented out. We plan to order the t-shirts at a cost of $15 per shirt and the design printing charges separate. For the vinyl stickers, per sticker would cost around 0.8 - 1 dollar.',

I am glad to hear that you appreciate my idea, and I will work on providing a more detailed plan for the workshop.\nSo regarding the proposed agenda, sessions/topics, and deliverables. Our agenda will include a mix of both non-technical and a bit technical sessions which are as follow:\nIntroduction to the Graph ecosystem that includes the detailed guidance of all the roles\nUnderstanding subgraph development and its importance\nHow Sub-streams Work\nNetworking and community building sessions\nIntroduction to the Advocates program and how to become an advocate\nOur expected number of onboarding people in the all the roles collectively can push to 50 or more depending on how much their interests collide and in what roles in the ecosystem. My main goal would be increase in the number of individuals who are interested in and capable of becoming subgraph developers as most of the attendees there would be computer science students and a bit technical, as well as an increase in the number of people who join the Graph ecosystem as delegators, curators, and advocates.\nThis workshop will be recorded and will be uploaded on Graph Pakistan Youtube channel too so the people who didn’t join can have visuals too so they can catchup things even after the workshop.\nAlso i have found a more cost-effective solution for the rent and feeding budget. I have decided to rent a smaller space, which has reduced the cost of rent from $2000 to $1500. Additionally, we will be serving snacks instead of meals, which will reduce the food budget from $900-1000 to $500.\nTherefore, the new grant amount i am requesting is $3500.',

Here are my responses to your questions:\nI am planning to have one workshop initially to introduce the Graph ecosystem and subgraph development to the attendees. However if there is enough feedback from the community I would organise more in the coming future that would be more technical, hopefully in September.\nAnd yes the five topics that I listed are technical and non technical both as I believe it’s important to cater to attendees with varying levels of technical expertise. Also I told, the community there would be mostly of computer science students from mid semesters who aren’t that technical yet and proper technical session for them may result in a burden for them so I want to take my community step by step with me as I am a front end developer too and in a process of learning web3 dev. The technical sessions will cover subgraph development(not deep) and sub streams working. I will be leading these sessions as I am a technical person with a wide circle of developers and some of them will be assisting me at the workshop. Additionally I will be taking help from Paka too before the workshop. And the attendees would be with their own devices.\nThe budget breakdown is as follows:\nRent for the venue: ~1500$\nSnacks and refreshments for attendees: ~500$\n50 Shirts: ~1000$ ( per shirt 15-16$ with printing costs separate)\n500 Stickers: ~300$\nequipments and materials: ~200$\nI expect to have around 2 assistants for now who would be developers as well but the number can increase as I plan things more accordingly with time as the event will take place in the early June.\nI hope this information helps, and I look forward to hearing back from you.',

I am wholeheartedly in support of your initiative!\nIn regards to cost reduction, I would like to offer a suggestion that may be of interest. Given that your project is aimed at nurturing future developers, you might consider reaching out to local universities or colleges to inquire about the availability of an auditorium for hosting the event. Oftentimes, educational institutions are eager to support initiatives like yours, as they recognize the value it could bring to their students. By securing a venue at no cost, you could significantly reduce your overall expenses.\nGood luck with this proposal!',

This limited the number of people to a single institute who could benefit from the event, and I realised the need to have a venue to accommodate students from different universities.\nHence, organising this upcoming event at a venue will allow more students from various universities to attend and benefit from the workshop.\nOnce again, thank you for your feedback and support',

Through targeted funding, we aim to create a dedicated platform that fosters education, skill development, and collaboration in The Graph ecosystem. This grant will enable us to organize local meetups, set up the GraphGuru infrastructure, host small meetups, strategic partnerships, and enhance our online presence. By doing so, we will empower Graph enthusiasts to become experts, facilitate knowledge sharing, and cultivate a vibrant Graph protocol community in India.\nI have read and agree to the privacy policy:\ntrue\nDescribe what your project does or is aiming to do in 50 characters or less:\nIt will focus with the goal of:\nCreate a strong Online presence\nBuild an On-ground presence with recurring local meetups\nSupporting Graph at major events\nStrategic partnerships\nGraphGuru infrastructure\nThe initial effort and focus for all 2023 will be on two major points:\nEcosystem Growth: onboard more Graph Advocates.\nLearning: onboard more Developers.\nIf available, please enter a link to your project below:\ndocs.google.com\nGround Operations 2023 9\nThe Graph India On Ground Presence wrt Agenda 2023 Introduction 1 Purpose of the Grant 1 Grant Utilization 2 Budget 3 The Graph India 4 Conclusion 4 Introduction The Graph India Community is becoming instrumental in promoting the adoption and...\nHow far along are you?:\nProgress: We have successfully assembled a highly capable team to undertake this project. Our team comprises three members: Ujjwal Thakur, who serves as the Education/Training Coordinator, Megabyte, who fulfills the role of Technical Graph Coordinator, and Yash Jagpat, also serving as a Technical Graph Coordinator.\nFurthermore, we have completed the development of a comprehensive charter for “The Graph India.”\nStatus: Thus far, we have successfully onboarded over 30 Advocates in our WhatsApp Group.\nIn collaboration with Naruto the co-founder of web3samaj, Paolo Diomede from The Graph, and two Polygon Guilds named Jaipur and Pune, we recently conducted an online Twitter Space event. This event garnered significant attention, with a total of 7,483 post views and 176 individuals tuning in for the space.\nNext steps: Our immediate objectives include the establishment of our GraphGuru infrastructure, organizing small meetups, forging strategic partnerships, and further enhancing our online presence.\nWhy did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you’re making?:\nWe chose this idea to work on due to several compelling reasons.\nThrough “The Graph India,” we seek to empower developers by providing them with the necessary resources, education, and support to effectively utilize The Graph. Our project will offer valuable educational materials, tutorials, and workshops specifically tailored to the Indian developer community. We believe that by equipping developers with the knowledge and tools to leverage The Graph, we can foster innovation and drive the adoption of web3 technologies in India.\nSecondly, our team members possess extensive domain expertise in this area, which enables us to effectively address the challenges and opportunities present in the field. Each team member brings valuable knowledge and experience, allowing us to approach the project with confidence and competence.\n-Charchit Kumawat Ex-Web3 Growth at Helix (Onboarded Clients like Okx, Chiliz & Dimo)\n-Megabyte from PolygonJaipur\n-Yash Jagpat from PolygonPune\n-Ujjwal Thakur Experianced Graphadvocate.\nWe know there is a need for what we’re creating through “The Graph India” project based on several factors.\n-There is a growing interest in web3 technologies and decentralized applications.\n-In India there is a demand for a dedicated platform offering educational resources and networking opportunities tailored to The Graph ecosystem.\n-We also experiance the awareness for The Graph is very limited in India.\nWhat’s new about what you’re making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn’t exist yet (or they don’t know about it)?:\nWhat’s new about what we’re making?\nDedicated Focus: Our project is specifically tailored to cater to the needs of the Indian developer and graph enthusiast community. By concentrating our efforts on the Indian market, we can provide localized resources, education, and support that align with the specific challenges and requirements of developers in this region.\nComprehensive Platform: “The Graph India” aims to provide a holistic platform that encompasses various aspects of The Graph ecosystem. We offer a centralized hub for educational materials, tutorials, workshops, community engagement, and networking opportunities. Our platform aims to be a one-stop destination for individuals seeking to learn, collaborate, and contribute to the growth of The Graph ecosystem in India.\nOur community-driven approach emphasizes engagement, collaboration, and leadership. Through meetups, online workshops, and partnerships, we bring together developers, enthusiasts, and industry professionals to lead by example. This sets us apart and enhances the value of “The Graph India.”\nWhat substitutes do people resort to because it doesn’t exist yet (or they don’t know about it)?\nGeneric Resources: Developers often rely on general online resources, tutorials, and documentation related to The Graph. While these resources provide some information, they may not specifically address the unique challenges and considerations of The Graph within the Indian context.\nFragmented Information: Existing information related to The Graph ecosystem and its utilization in India may be scattered across various sources, making it challenging for individuals to access comprehensive and up-to-date information in one centralized location.\nLimited Networking Opportunities: The absence of a dedicated platform focused on The Graph in India might limit networking opportunities for developers and graph enthusiasts. They may miss out on valuable connections, collaborations, and partnerships that could further their understanding and engagement with the graph technology ecosystem.\nWhat’s your vision for how your project will impact The Graph and/or web3?:\nThe purpose of this grant is to establish and support the GraphGuru Local Chapter for The Graph India Community. Through targeted funding, we aim to create a dedicated platform that fosters education, skill development, and collaboration in The Graph graph ecosystem. This grant will enable us to organize local meetups, set up the GraphGuru infrastructure, host small meetups, strategic partnerships, and enhance our online presence. By doing so, we will empower Graph enthusiasts to become experts, facilitate knowledge sharing, and cultivate a vibrant Graph protocol community in India.\nWhat we want to achieve with The Graph India is:\n-Empowering, supporting and providing guidance to bootstrap The Graph India community.\n-Create a sense of belonging for The Graph India community.\nGrow the developer community.\n-Avoid over delivering, but focusing on high quality meetups and building partnerships.\n-Avoid arranging meetups just for free swags but focus on connecting people and create long term retention.\n-Sharing projects developed using the Graph Protocol.\n-Creating opportunities for Indian developers to join the Graph Protocol ecosystem and pursue careers within the network.\nHow will you measure success?:\n-Social media followers on relevant platforms.\n-Engagement rates on social media posts.\n-New partnerships established.\n-Booth traffic and engagement at events.\n-New community members acquired at Event (e.g., new Graph Advocates onboarded).\n-Partnerships or collaboration opportunities developed at Event.\n-Subgraph developer onboarded through our Educational and Training Program\nWhat milestones will you achieve in the coming weeks/months, with or without the grant?:\nOnline Presence\nEnhancing the online presence of the GraphGuru Local Chapter through various digital platforms. This includes creating and maintaining dedicated social media post, organzing Twitter Space with partnership and leveraging online marketing strategies to attract a wider audience. Grant funds will be used to cover the social media management, online advertising, and any associated fees.\nPartnership with Indian Tech Communities\nBuilding strategic partnerships with other Indian tech communities and organizations that share a similar interest in community buildup. Funds will be used to establish collaborative initiatives, joint events, and knowledge-sharing platforms with these communities. This may include sponsorship of joint workshops, conferences or webinars, as well as the development of shared resources and educational materials.\nPlease select who you think will benefit from your project?:\nSubgraph Developers\nHow much funding are you looking for?

My primary responsibility was to drive adoption and promote the value proposition of the product within the web3 ecosystem.\nWhy are you interested in contributing to The Graph and/or web3?:\nWe are interested in contributing to The Graph because it is one of the most important tech stacks for building any DApp. It plays a crucial role in developing complete decentralized applications. We are inspired by The Graph’s efforts towards decentralization and strongly align with its vision.

I would like to answer a few questions related to this\n1/ We already have a podcast that has been educating people about valuable protocols on web3 in Hindi for about an year. And we have grown from 200 subs to 20k in about 10 months\n2/ THe design is for the Youtube Thumbnail posters. We have a full-time employee to create those for us. Since we have a video every day to be posted. The design is definitely living up to the standards and helping us get viewership. Also, the video production helps us provide the best-in-class content which is appreciated by people who see the videos\n3/ WE have a full-time designer and a community person as well to help us with the research on the podcast we have been doing. Since the podcast is for 1 hour it requires a good amount of content to be published hence we need both positions to make the podcast worth viewers time\n4/ It takes about 7 days starting with research to successfully publish the video\nThe education we are providing has been the best in class for about an year and we have done about 100+ episodes already watch about 1 hour. Hence we are looking for a support from the graph advocates dao on the efforts to keep working on our mission to support Indians to grow with the right knowledge',

Thanks for the application of your idea, your podcasts look really professional and I’ve enjoyed it!\nFully support the concept of your application.\nAt the same time it would be fine if you make more clear the following points:\n#1. I agree @juliannaMLN, it would be nice if you clarify which tools does your designer use for YouTube video thumbnails creation?\nIf I use tools like Canva for thumbnails creation for my YouTube channel, I spend generally from 1 to 5 hours for each thumbnail depending on its complexity, originality and presence of pre-defined templates in its composition. So it is quite enough to produce 2 thumbnails per day. If your designer is professional and have broad experience in this field, maybe he can produce even more per day. From this point of view, your requested funding amount for thumbnails seems very high in my opinion and can be reduced in 10 times (e. g. for two thumbnails).\nMaybe it makes sense request assistance from The Graph Advocates. For example we have skilled and productive designer with broad skillset Andy Schreiber @TheGraphgermany, so if advocates with such skills have time and opportunities to assist, various options are possible.\n#2. Who is “SEO person” and what are his functions in your team?\n#3. Which operations are meant in the point #3 of the funding breakdown?\n#4. Podcast is a very interactive tool, do you have plans to invite your colleagues-advocates and introduce them to your Indian audience?\nThank you so much for your application again. I really like podcasts and glad that such application did appear. Hope it will be approved.',

We have developed and published a series of blockchain and cryptocurrency courses in Arabic, reaching hundreds of users to date.\nWe have an established online platform, active social media channels, and a dedicated team that continuously works on producing high-quality educational content. However, there’s a lot more we aim to achieve, particularly expanding our course offerings to include more blockchain protocols and advanced topics, while growing our user base across the MENA region. This grant will expedite our progress towards these goals.\nWhy did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you’re making?:\nThe inspiration behind IqraCrypto stems from recognizing the gap in quality blockchain education in Arabic. With over 480 million Arabic speakers worldwide, and a growing interest in blockchain and cryptocurrencies, we identified an untapped market that desperately needed our service.\nOur team has strong domain expertise in both blockchain and education, with years of experience in developing and delivering high-quality educational content. We’ve been observing the crypto ecosystem for years and noticed the scarcity of resources in Arabic. The strong reception and positive feedback to our current courses have further validated the need for what we’re offering.\nFurthermore, with rising internet penetration and smartphone usage in the MENA region, coupled with a younger demographic interested in new technologies, we’re confident in the demand for our platform and the critical role it can play in accelerating blockchain adoption in the region.\nWhat’s new about what you’re making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn’t exist yet (or they don’t know about it)?:\nWhat sets IqraCrypto apart is the unique combination of offering comprehensive, high-quality blockchain education exclusively in Arabic. Our platform provides a tailored learning experience that caters to the specific cultural and linguistic nuances of the Arabic-speaking community.\nUntil now, Arabic speakers have had to rely on English resources for learning about blockchain, leading to potential misunderstandings due to language barriers, or resort to fragmented, often unreliable sources in Arabic. Additionally, the lack of structured educational paths in the field has made it difficult for beginners to navigate their learning journey.\nBy bridging this language gap, we’re offering a one-stop solution where Arabic speakers can gain blockchain knowledge from zero to advanced levels, all in their native language. This convenience and focus on quality education in Arabic differentiate us from other learning platforms. Moreover, our continuous efforts to expand and update our content ensure we stay relevant in this rapidly evolving space.\nWhat’s your vision for how your project will impact The Graph and/or web3?:\nOur vision for IqraCrypto aligns directly with the inclusive ethos of Web3 and The Graph’s commitment to decentralization and accessibility. By creating high-quality educational content about blockchain and The Graph specifically in Arabic, we aim to empower a significant yet underserved demographic of nearly half a billion Arabic speakers globally.\nIn the long term, we envision IqraCrypto as a catalyst in the adoption and development of Web3 technologies in the MENA region. By familiarizing the Arabic-speaking community with The Graph, we intend to increase its usage and thereby strengthen its ecosystem. This will also attract more developers and users to the platform.\nOur impact will extend beyond just The Graph, contributing to a more diverse, vibrant, and equitable web3 ecosystem. By providing resources in Arabic, we help ensure that the shift to a decentralized web doesn’t leave behind non-English speaking communities, fostering true global inclusion.\nHow will you measure success?:\nSuccess for our project with The Graph would be measured by:\nUser Adoption: The number of unique users interacting with our course on The Graph, as well as completion rates of the course.\nIncreased Awareness: A noticeable increase in the understanding and awareness of The Graph in the MENA region, measured through surveys and community interactions.\nCommunity Contributions: Success would also involve an increase in the number of subgraphs developed by users who’ve completed our course.\nActive Application: Real-world usage of The Graph by our users, measured by tracking their activities on The Graph after completing our course.\nFeedback: Positive community feedback and improvement suggestions would also be an important success metric, helping us refine the course for future learners.\nThrough these metrics, we aim to contribute to the growth and development of The Graph in the MENA region and beyond.\nWhat milestones will you achieve in the coming weeks/months, with or without the grant?:\nMilestone 1: Introduction to The Graph and Its Unique Technology - Estimated Cost: $6,000\n-Script for course content (Arabic)\n-Slides and visual aids for the course (Arabic and English)\n-Recorded video of the course (Arabic and English)\n-Publishing the course on IqraCrypto and sharing on social media platforms\n-One blog post summarizing the course content\n-Three infographic or similar pieces of shareable social media content\nMilestone 2: Deep Dive into The Graph Ecosystem - Estimated Cost: $6,000\n-Script for course content (Arabic)\n-Slides and visual aids for the course (Arabic and English)\n-Recorded video of the course (Arabic and English)\n-Publishing the course on IqraCrypto and sharing on social media platforms\n-One blog post summarizing the course content\n-Four infographic or similar pieces of shareable social media content\nMilestone 3: Building on The Graph - Estimated Cost: $7,000\n-Script for course content (Arabic)\n-Slides and visual aids for the course (Arabic and English)\n-Recorded video of the course (Arabic and English)\n-Publishing the course on IqraCrypto and sharing on social media platforms\n-One blog post summarizing the course content\n-Three infographic or similar pieces of shareable social media content\nMilestone 4: Learn and Earn in Arabic - Estimated Cost: $6,000\n-A dedicated page on iqracrypto.com 3 to learn all the videos and answer a quiz, if the quiz is successful they will get rewards or benefits.\n-Four infographic or similar pieces of shareable social media content\nThe grant would significantly expedite these processes and help us reach our objectives in a more timely and impactful manner.\nEach milestone will take around 4-6 weeks\nPlease select who you think will benefit from your project?:\nOther, Curators, Delegators, Subgraph Developers\nHow much funding are you looking for?

The Graph, in particular, has been instrumental in powering this decentralization by providing a secure and efficient way for dApps to access blockchain data.\nOur interest lies in spreading awareness and knowledge about these emerging technologies to the vast Arabic speaking population. We believe that by educating more people about The Graph and web3, we can empower them to be active participants in the web3 ecosystem. This aligns perfectly with our mission to democratize access to blockchain education, and we are excited about the prospect of contributing to the growth of The Graph and the wider web3 ecosystem.\nAre you applying as a team or individual?:\nTeam\nWhat type of grant are you pursuing?:\nProject (one-off)\nPlease select the category your project best fits into:\nEducation\n\n\n\nPrimary Community Poll\nDo you fundamentally support this grant application, knowing that the final scope and grant amount may differ from the requested proposal?\nYou need to be a member of trust_level_1,trust_level_2,trust_level_3,trust_level_4 to vote in this poll.\nYes\nNo\n12\nvoters\nVotes are public.\nResults will be shown on vote.\n\n\n\nGrant Committee Vote\nDo you recommend this grant to the DAO?\n80%\nNo\n20%\nYes\n5\nvoters\nShow vote',

             'text_comment': 'Greetings!\nThank you for taking the time to apply! In the process of reviewing it, I had a few questions:\n1/ I wasn’t quite sure what value this would bring specifically to The Graph and DAO, on the community side. After analyzing the information provided, I, alas, did not see any clear KPI, such as the number of users (50 thousand looks too strange).\n2/ On budget. Alas, at this stage I think that the amount you are asking for the types of your work are very excessive.\nHere, for example, you can ask for help from our advocates, as we have some pretty talented people who can help with this.\nadmin:\nInfographics creation: $1,000\nI have read some of your blogs and have come to the conclusion that paying $500 each time, I think, is grossly overpriced. Alternatively, explain to me where that price is coming from.\nadmin:\nBlog post creation: $500\nNext, on posting and on creating a course. Going to the site and taking your grant with Dfinity as an example, I opened this course. Unfortunately I saw there only 1 video, which is clearly not worth $4.000, the same I can say about the course. Explain then, what is the value of this course? And what you are going to provide us.\nadmin:\nCourse content creation (script, slides, video recording): $4,000\nAlso, I looked through your social networks and did not see a high number of people or will you use any additional resources to promote this course or is DAO just paying for future advertising?\nadmin:\nCourse publishing and social media sharing: $500\n3/ How are you going to retain those people who complete your course? Since other than $2k for prizes for the quiz I couldn’t find any information.\nadmin:\nRewards for successful quiz completions: $2,000\nIn general, summing up some intermediate results, I would say that the proposal has something to work on, at least start with working out a budget, setting more real and specific goals, both to attract new people and to develop the grant.',

Here are responses to the concerns you’ve raised:\n1/ Regarding the value for The Graph and DAO: Our primary KPI revolves around the number of educated and well-informed users we aim to cultivate. We agree that stating a flat figure like 50 thousand may seem arbitrary. We aim to get a significant portion of the MENA region’s budding crypto users knowledgeable about The Graph and the underlying tech. As for precise figures, we’ll work on developing a more data-driven projection and share that with you soon.\n2/ On the budget: We’ve formulated the costs based on the time, effort, and resources necessary to create high-quality educational material.\nInfographics: We believe that an effective infographic is more than just design. It’s about representing complex information quickly and clearly. The cost includes the research, design, and revisions to ensure we accurately represent the subject matter.\nBlog posts: We base the cost on the research required, the time it takes to write and edit, and the unique insight we offer. The content isn’t merely informational but tailored to educate and engage the community.\nCourse Content: The cost of course creation is not just about recording a video. It involves planning the curriculum, scriptwriting, creating engaging visual aids, recording, editing, and post-production.\nSocial Media Sharing: We’ll be leveraging our existing network for promotion, but we also plan on using strategic social media campaigns to reach a larger audience.\n3/ Retaining People: We aim to create a robust community around The Graph, where users will not just complete a single course but continue to engage with the platform and other learners. The rewards for successful quiz completions are not just a gimmick but a part of a larger strategy to encourage active participation and continuous learning.\nWe’ll take your advice and further refine our proposal, particularly our budget and goals, to make them more specific and realistic. Your feedback is invaluable, and we appreciate the time you’ve taken to help us improve.\nBest regards,',

At first glance, this proposal is exhaustive but not very specific to the Graph. In fact, the Graph is mentioned there only a few times and quite vaguely, in my opinion.\n1. Specificity to The Graph: Our intent is to create a detailed and thorough curriculum around The Graph. This will include understanding the protocol, how to use it, the role of Indexers, Curators, Delegators, and how individuals can participate. We have mentioned The Graph minimally in the initial proposal to avoid information overload, but rest assured, the actual content will be deeply centered around The Graph.\njuliannaMLN:\nThe budget request is indeed high, and as I can see your e-learning platform isn’t free to use - it costs 40$ per month for each user. Are you planning to change that for the Graph specific content and community?\n2. The cost: We would like to clarify that we do not operate on a subscription model. Our users pay per course, which ranges between $15 to $40. For the Graph-specific content, the courses will be free and accessible on both the platform and Youtube mainly to drive higher engagement and adoption of the Graph in the MENA region.\njuliannaMLN:\nLeaving the final costs aside, I’m also curious about educational content and resources based on which you are planning to develop the content for the course. Can you also share these resources? I believe that there are already at least a few to choose from high-quality courses in the space which only need to be translated into Arabic.

Our plan is not just to translate these resources, but to curate, customize and present them in a way that is easy to understand and culturally relevant to our target audience. The budget reflects the time, effort, and resources required to create high-quality videos, infographics, quizzes, and other interactive content to enhance the learning experience.\nAs we endeavour to contribute positively to the Graph ecosystem, we welcome any further suggestions or areas of focus that you might think we should incorporate. We remain flexible and are willing to consider a counter-proposal that would meet both our goals while still delivering the anticipated value to the Arabic-speaking audience.\nThanks and regards,',

Maybe in the future if there is a need and drive from the communities then I will focus on building new ones, however, I have spoken to and got the opinions and thoughts from the best advocates DAO members who are well respected and speak the truth about this feature. They have all told me to prioritise this new feature over building the 3 new chatbots as they believe it’s worth and can see its potential for not only existing but definitely new and budding advocates. They seem as excited for the feature as I am building it, it has been a long time coming as the idea has been sat in my notepad for a few months now, it is time to bring it to life.\nAs always I have already started developing this feature however it is in its very very early stages. I will share a video of this in the comments section below so please scroll down to view after reading this proposal, I have the logic, layout etc of the starting feature and a few questions that I have wrote so that you can see the idea, format of the questions and answers.\nI have been informed that it has been an issue in the past where advocates have been conducting interviews with budding advocates who are simply not ready or do not know enough about the roles and responsibilities of the advocate role that they desire. Wasting the time of both parties and taking up the valuable time of advocates who could have spent their time doing other tasks or interviewing other capable candidates. On the flip side I have pushed and guided many community members towards advocacy after doubting myself for a long time. And the question I asked myself was the same as others have asked me directly… “Am I Advocate ready?”. Well, until now the only way to tell is by doing your own research, learning through reading the documentation and then applying for the interview and see if you have what it takes.\nThis is where my new feature idea came from, it is a quiz / revision and educational aid for those community members who may be sitting on the fence. For those people who are not sure what it takes to become an advocate and want to learn. For those who know what it takes but want to give their self a confidence check before applying. All of those who have asked their self, “Am I Advocate ready?” or “What does it take to be a Graph Advocate?”, this feature is for you!\nIt will be a 4 part feature, all of this is new to me so I will be learning as I code so the timeline for this project will likely slip to the right but I want to learn and make it the best I can, so if it takes a little longer in development and beta testing then I am okay with that. As long as the finished product is the best I can possible make it then I will be doing that to benefit the community and future advocates.\nThere will be a guided revision / guided documentation section where the user can find all the documentation, guides etc at the tips of their fingers, this may even have an additional feature on a search function in the future (again this is new to me but this will be the long term vision to allow everything to be as easy for the user as possible), what advocate roles entail, the code of conducts, the time you should put into the role and contributions., events, grant opportunities and swag bundles and the list goes on…\nThen there will be another revision section. Where the user can test their self with flip / flash cards, a question on the front and the answer on the back, the questions taken right out of the documentation that they have access to learn.\nThere will be quiz’s with multiple choice for those who prefer to learn by taking mock test where they can see the answer within a group of answers to trigger their memory. The user can specify the topic they want to concentrate on, along with easy, medium and hard difficulties.\nThe user will see the timer and their score as they progress through the revision mock tests and receive feedback on where to look for the correct answer if they do get any wrong.\nAnd then one final test where the user will be questioned on everything at random, selected from all topics and a selection of easy, medium and hard questions. The final quiz will be timed and the score will be displayed at the end. The certificate will be downloadable as proof to the AdvocatesDAO members conducting the interview, there will be a minimum pass mark and maximum time mark, if the user has extra educational needs then this will be taken into account with extra time allocated where necessary. Allowing more time if needed for dyslexia and in the future I hope to utilise a text to speech additional feature so that the user can have the questions and answers read to them if they struggle to do so under exam conditions.\nI hope to evolve this feature in the future to provide the users with POAPS for completing the quiz and successfully enrolling as a graph advocate. With the further advancements of monthly POAP raffles for users to win community stag bundles (I will be seeking sponsorships for this when the time comes and I hope to produce some GRTDataHub swag for the first time ever).\nIf you have got this far within the proposal then I hope this proposal excited you as much as it does me and the other advocates who I have shared it with prior to starting the development. I look forward to the feedback from the community and advocates within the forum. Please be open and honest and if you have any additional ideas, please share!\nAfter proposing my new feature idea to an advocate they came back with this great improvements and it really does make sense to me to implement it into the app from the offset.\nThe final exam will take into account the role that the user will be applying for. For example, lets say you want to have a role as a Content Creator. Let’s say you come to this test, there’s a small introduction, what this role is about, maybe examples of work. And then it’s on to passing the test.\nSo my feedback to this was to implement this from the start, I will be having it so the user selects their roles they want to apply for when taking the final exam. I can make it so they choose their “role” it then logs then and displays it in the certificate and then I code it to bias questions towards the role that they will be doing. This was you are not getting Content Creators being asked Technical Teacher questions and vice versa. As an experienced dev will find some questions easy when a non-dev Content creator would find them very hard, even though they have been taken from the Technical Teacher “easy” question bank.\nI have read and agree to the privacy policy:\ntrue\nAre you applying as a team or individual?:\nIndividual\nWhat type of grant are you pursuing?:\nProject (one-off)\nPlease select the category your project best fits into:\nEducation\nPlease select who you think will benefit from your project?:\nOther, Indexers, Delegators, Curators, Subgraph Developers\nHow much funding are you looking for? (USD):\n3000\nProvide a breakdown of your requested funding:\nProposed Work\n“Are you Advocate ready?” – Question set. Research, time taken to write questions which will be ever expanding to cover the content for the user to learn. This question set will most definitely be over 100 questions initially with extra variations as more time goes on to prevent cheating / handing over of answers from previous advocates. The questions and answers I have written so far on average have taken me 5-10 minutes to write. A few example questions can be found below:\nWhat is the vision of The Graph and how does the Graph Advocates program contribute to this vision?\nA) The Graph’s vision is to build a decentralized network of public data, while the Graph Advocates program empowers individuals to actively participate in web3 and make lasting contributions.\nB) The Graph’s vision is to build a centralized network of public data, while the Graph Advocates program empowers individuals to passively participate in web3.\nC) The Graph’s vision is to build a decentralized network of private data, while the Graph Advocates program empowers individuals to actively participate in web3 and make lasting contributions.\nD) The Graph’s vision is to build a centralized network of private data, while the Graph Advocates program empowers individuals to passively participate in web3.\nAnswer: A\nWhat are some examples of conduct that Advocates are prohibited from engaging in?\nA) Discrimination, verbal harassment, and using inappropriate language\nB) Name-calling, inciting violence, and discussing the price of GRT\nC) Misrepresenting affiliations or engaging in marketing for personal gain\nD) All of the above\nAnswer: D\nHow should Advocates provide information about other participants or stakeholder groups in the protocol?\nA) By suggesting specific Indexers to delegate with or subgraphs to curate\nB) By providing general resources and educational materials\nC) By recommending certain products or services\nD) By endorsing specific companies or organisations\nAnswer: B\nWhat is the responsibility of Advocates if they are unable to utilise the resources around them?\nA) To remain silent and not contribute to the ecosystem\nB) To continue trying to navigate through different situations on their own\nC) To reach out to domain experts, ecosystem partners, or other Advocates for assistance\nD) To act unprofessionally and engage in inappropriate conduct\nAnswer: C\nWhat is the purpose of the Advocates Program?\nA) To promote price speculation and investment advice\nB) To allow Advocates to engage in personal gain\nC) To support The Graph ecosystem through high-quality content and community contributions\nD) To create a community where disparaging comments are encouraged\nAnswer: C\nHow should Advocates act when collecting feedback, criticism, or during times of disagreement?\nA) By using inappropriate language or engaging in arguments\nB) By being highly sarcastic or using emotionally charged language or tone\nC) By acting disruptively to the ecosystem\nD) By acting professionally and using appropriate language and tone, while respecting others’ right to privacy\nAnswer: D\nBuild the flip / flash card revision feature that includes variations of the questions in the exam but not the exact questions to reduce cheating from participants but allowing the user to learn the content.\nBuild the mock exams for each topic with 3 levels of difficulty. The mock exam will be a 4 answer multiple choice and show the user if they get it right and if they get it wrong, they will be told the correct answer with the supporting documentation to aid their learning.\nBuild the documentation/ tutorial finder with the possibility of a search function. Allowing the user to quickly and easily find all the content they need to aid their learning experience and make it as easy as possible.\nBuild the final exam, a 4 answer multiple choice but the users score and time will only show on the certificate at the end of the exam.\nBeta testing for all the features mentioned above, feedback takes and questions re-categorised if needed and improvements made.\nAs always, this project will be continuously improved as new content arrives and to ensure the same questions and answers can’t be passed from one advocate to the other over a period of months.\nTimeline & Further detailed explanation about each component within the feature\nThe dates below are personal deadlines. However, these deadlines may be fluid and move from left to right depending on the progress of the building. With this feature I will be learning almost all of it as I go and making it the best I can before it is ready for beta testing. The beta testing phase will be lengthy due to the complexity of the testing and question categorisation. Each question can take up to 5 minutes to write, depending on the content / context. These will likely need to be altered and tailored in the future. I wish to create an expansive question bank, with this being open source I will allow advocate DAO members to push their new questions to GitHub and merge to ensure it is ever growing. But this is also something that I will continue to do.\nThe community knows me and that I take pride in my work, I will ensure the end result is finished to the best of my ability before moving onto the next phase. I want this feature to be an asset to the community and produce the next generation of high calibre Advocates that will teach tomorrows applicants.\n“Are you Advocate ready?” start date, 10th Apr 2023. The development has started and I am building all the logic and layout etc of the Quiz homepage with options to what feature the user want to use.\nBuild the Question set, assign them to topics and categorise difficulty. This will be ever expanding. Each question can take 5 minutes or longer to ensure it is non-ambiguous, well worded and the answers are correct and justified to not lead the user astray.\nBuild the flip / flash card revision feature with Questions on one side and answers on the other to allow users who learn this way to gain knowledge and utilise the app for their learning prior to taking the final exam.\nBuild the mock exams for each topic, once again allowing the users who learn best this way by seeing a correct answer amongst other answers that they can select from memory as this is the best way they learn. There will be 3 mock exams for each topic for the easy, medium and hard difficulties. Numbers of topics to be decided when writing the question set.\nBuilding the documentation / tutorial finder with the potential for a search function to ensure the user can find the content needed to learn about the advocates scheme, the roles, code of conduct and what the benefits of being an advocate are.\nBuild the final exam where the user will take the test without being able to see their time or score until they are on the downloadable certificate at the end, which can be used when applying for an interview with the possibility of a POAP to be claimable in the future.\nI have not assigned dates within this work timeline as I currently have no idea on the timescale, I can predict 2-3 months however I will keep the forum updated as the development progresses so check back every few weeks!\nThis total is for the 2-3 months that I am guesstimating it will take to make this feature, I apologies that I cannot be more precise at this. I will provide updates in the forum as the development progresses. I really look forward to having this idea out there for the community and future advocates to benefit from.\nThe time for labour building the feature, writing the questions and hosting within the app.\nContinuous improvement as new potential roles come up within the Graph Advocates, along with refreshing the question set and answers over a period of time to ensure the content is not old and stale. As new documentation is pushed out this will be incorporated into the feature to ensure the user can easily find it, learn and test their self.\nWorking within the communities within the extensive Beta testing phase, ensuring the topics, question set and content is 100% accurate with questions correctly categorised for users and making the relevant changes / updated where necessary throughout the feature.\nHave you applied for (or already received) funding from somewhere else?:\nYes\nIf yes, please describe where you’ve received funding from and how much you have, or will, receive:\nThe Graph - GRTDataHub App Analytics - Wave 6 = $2,000\nGraph Advocates DAO\n$2,000 per chatbots, English, German, French, Turkish, Spanish. = $10,000\nHindi, Urdu, Ukraninan chatbot grant awaiting final payment for work carried out. - $2,000 per chatbot = $6,000.\nWhat’s your vision for how your project will impact The Graph and/or web3?:\nI believe this feature will bring a higher calibre of advocates joining up to the scheme. It will allow those who are sat on the fence to take that step forward to becoming an advocate, taking on a role and becoming active within the ecosystem. The questions are surprisingly hard to write, ensuring they are unambiguous with a clear correct answer and others that are close but not misleading. The beta testing phase of this feature will be long due to its complexity and “categorising” and testing of the questions from each topic. For example an experience Technical Teacher will find certain questions a lot easier than a Content Creator. But as more advocates test and provide feedback to the question set and the questions will be placed into their correct difficulty ranges.\nWhat can you share about any past work that is relevant to this grant?:\nSince GRTDataHub has been brought to life which was once a dream to me. I have pushed myself to work on it on a daily basis (3-5 hours each evening). I have fallen in love with coding and I want to build tools to help others to participate within The Graph and wider Web3 ecosystem. So far the other tools and features within the app have receievd a great reception from all communities and advcates that I have had the pleasure of collaborating with. I always put 100% effort into any feature that I build, ensuring it is beta tested and ready for public use. Only then will I release it. Thus far I have build 8 chatbots for communities all around the world.\nMy work on this new feature will be no different, I will make it the best it can possible be before releasing it for the communties to benefit from.\nWhy are you interested in contributing to The Graph and/or web3?:\nI, myself have not always been on the technical side of Web3. I start off as a Commnity Helper, Web3 welcomer and Content Creator within Graphtronauts before the Advocates program was live.\nIt then took me almost 12 months of working daily, teaching myself how to code via a £15.99 online course. Hours upon hours of frustration, learning, loathing and loving my new hobby / skill. I am very fortunate to be in a position now where I can create tools to help those within The Graoh and Web3 who were once in my position. Unsure where they can assist without being a dev, unsure where to find the documentation, content, tutorials and how to test theirself to see if they have what it takes without being shot down with the feeling of failing an interview.\nMy goal is to encourage those who are under confident, who need a touch a guidance or re assurance to take that leap and give it a go. The gentle nudge to assist someone who is sat on the fence to take that leap and go for it! Just become someone is not a developer does not mean they cannot contribute within Web3 or The Graph ecosystem.\nThere are lots of other roles that will be well suited and where individuals will thrive, only if they take the time to learn, test their self and go for it. My aim is to make this feature will facilitate that.\nAs there is a lot of content within this feature I am unsure of the timeframe right now to build it, as you can see from the proposal I have the idea and how it will work but I will be learning and developing at the same time, which is great because it is what I love and what I push anyone within the communities to do!\nIf I can make a difference within the ecosystem from persiverse, strong will and the eagerness to learn then I believe I can create tools to get others to do the same.\n\n\n\nPrimary Community Poll\nDo you fundamentally support this grant application, knowing that the final scope and grant amount may differ from the requested proposal?\n70%\nYes\n30%\nNo\n20\nvoters\nShow vote\n\n\n\nGrant Committee Vote\nDo you recommend this grant to the DAO?\n60%\nYes\n40%\nNo\n10\nvoters\nShow vote',

Secondly, I am still in the process of writing all the Qs and Answers which are just as important and as Qs their self. I plan on having different levels of beta testing (hence why it may be longer but this will be worthwhile). I will do this by asking for Advocate DAO members to review the question set, content etc and then another set of advocate DAO members to test these within the app. There will then be a 3rd set of AdvocateDAO member beta testing before the 2nd Phase of testing which will be open up to current (longest serving) graph advocates, then open to all graph advocates and the 3rd and final phase will be open to non-advocates (preferably a variety of people who want to become an advocate but don’t know if they have what it takes + people who do not know anything about it and see if they would apply for it after having learnt and taken the exam). It will then… be released for public use. The AdvocateDAO members involved in the 1st Phase will be updated on any proposed content change and if that is an overall pass then it will be amended. And if not, then we will resolve the issue to ensure both parties understand what the correct content should be to ensure future users are not misled by ambiguity.\nSorry for the long answer but I hope this answers your question.',

Some of the tools I’ve used for this in my educational career are Kahoot (https://kahoot.com/ 2), Quizlet (https://quizlet.com 1) and Google Classroom.\nYou could potentially use these existing platforms to create a similar educational experience. Doing so, you could focus on the content and educational materials rather than developing the technical infrastructure from scratch. This could save a significant amount of your time and our budget, which could then be used on other projects/grants.\nIf you scratch building the technical infrastructure, I believe creating the quiz itself could be a great Content Creation advocate contribution.\nI want to emphasize that I appreciate you and the time you put into writing this proposal, and this is just my personal suggestion.',

My feature within the app will be free forever once the feature is built and hosted by me. One of the reasons why I am selfishly very excited about this new feature is that it gives me a chance to further build upon my own coding skills which is something that I am very passionate about and I put 100% into everything that I build.\nI cannot see how using those platform that I will be able to hit hardly any of the points that I raised within the grant proposal above but maybe I can elaborate further:\nI also won’t be able to have all of the data in once place, easily accessible, open-source (which is one of the main reasons for building this) and if the websites get taken down then the other parts of the feature may fail because of it, rendering the user unable to fully benefit from what it is I am trying to create here.\nSo I’m not sure as to why taking away the 2 key learning features of the proposal would be beneficial at all other than me building them (as you can see above from a week ago I have already built the start of the quiz), and I will send an update here tonight as I have also started building the flash card feature. As I have with all grants, I usually start building way before I submit a grant. That’s due to my own enthusiasm around this project and bettering The Graph community.\nAs a keen new developer wanting to not only better myself, my passion and the graph ecosystem of other and future potential advocates. I am not a Content Creator but a developer and educational web3 welcomed in my eyes. I disagree that this grant should be stripped of the development / technical aspect and in theory “leased” out to an exciting multi-million pound company because they have a feature that already exists. If that was the case for everything within Web3 then surely no tools will ever be built? Once I have built these tools myself they will be continuously improved.\nI am hoping that as an Advocate DAO member your appreciate the time and effort from other advocates and community members to better The Graph ecosystem and Web3. Using existing platforms that are not open-source and are one point of failure, in my opinion is not at all the solution here. But I do appreciate that is your own opinion.\nI’m not sure how far into the proposal you read but I plan on creating other aspect such as a downloadable certificate for the user, to cater for their educational needs etc. not everyone learns the same way. I have not seen these websites before but I plan on making everything myself, in house and hosted within GRTDataHub. I do not wish to use external Web2 companies to create this content. I hope you appreciate my reasons behind this and see the deeper roots for not just using other online features.\n** EDIT **\nI cannot attach the video unfortunately but I will attach screenshots of what I have built thus far in terms of the flip cards feature.\nOnce again I want to highlight this is minimum styling as I am working on the logic for the features first as this is the most important part to me.\nThe when the user clicks the question it animated and flips over to reveal the answer.\nI am currently working on making the questions random each time they play so it isn’t the same order each time.',

             'text_comment': 'Thanks for your detailed response. I can see how passionate you are about this and I appreciate your enthusiasm to contribute to The Graph community and help aspiring Graph Advocates.\nI am glad to hear you are continuously improving your coding skills and I understand why you are building this from scratch. But here’s the thing: In my opinion the grant program of Graph AdvocatesDAO should not transform into a coding scholarship program. In my opinion it should be about funding projects that directly add value to our community, in the most efficient and impactful way possible. To my knowledge you are not an expert in development, nor an expert in education. Therefore, it does not seem efficient to me to fund this grant proposal.\nI understand the value of open-source and the power of independence, but I think we need to think about the scale of this project here. We’re talking about a relatively simple quiz tool that I expect will be used by tens of people per quarter. With that level of usage, I’m still not convinced it is effective to invest this amount of our budget, and your time, into building this from scratch.\nThe platforms I mentioned before do have paid plans, but they also have free versions that could do what you’re proposing. The cool thing about these platforms is that we get to stand on the shoulders of the experts in the field, and make use of well-built robust infrastructure. You could focus on the educational content leveraging the flawless UI/UX of these products. I am sure we can also find a way to distribute POAPs to people that finish the quiz.\nJust remember this is not a hard ‘no’. I see a lot of potential in improving the Graph Advocate onboarding experience. I just think there might be a more effective way to achieve your goals, and ours, at the same time. I hope you understand where I’m coming from, and please don’t take this the wrong way.',

As per the advocate documentation with regards to community grants, I am not trying to turn this into a coding scholarship by any means.\nPersonally, even just from talk to members of the community about this new feature it has already created a lot of excitement and interest, most most people continuing to say… we need that now! When will it be\nfinished? And that is before that have even see a showcase of it. Purely from a descriptive idea.\nI have always focused on community-building and educational efforts in The Graph ecosystem, I love both of these and I will continue to do so.\nI believe this new toll within the community will increase the community’s awareness around the advocate program, promote new and further engagement of new and old community members, bring a deeper level of understanding understanding, and allow more participation from fresh eyes with new ideas and views in The Graph and / or Web3 ecosystem. Which is the exact aim of the Graph Advocates DAO is it now?\nI respect your opinion but I truly do believe this tool will help a lot of community members to take that step to become a high calibre of Advocate and applying for all the right reasons.\nKind Regards,\nLiam',

You can have a look at this new video tutorial from Nader about how to do permanent file storage on Arweave using Bundlr (here 1).\nI look forward for this presentation to learn more about this project, and for now I voted Yes as the idea to help onboarding more Advocates is truly welcomed.',

And I welcome this!\nI have made sure the questions and answers logic within the code are in their own separate files. I have kept in mind that questions will be added and updated in the future. Making this easy for advocates to contribute, so making the quiz multi-lingual with advocate text-translators will also be easy! I would love to see that happen. It would be great seeing this tool used within all communities and I would happily build the infrastructure for that!\nFor the revision tools I can add a link to each question once the answer has been selected. I will definitely be doing that if the user selects the wrong answer, so they can educate their self easily as to what the correct answer is.\nI will definitely be making a certificate but I am still to figure out how I will execute this and in the best way.

              'text_post': 'Grant ID: 85zrx0036\nSummary:\nHello Graph Team, we would like to propose an idea to grow The Graph in the thriving Indian Community.\nSince November 2021, there has been a steady rise in crypto ownership in India, jumping from 14.7% to 30% in April 2022. Many people are investing in popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Indian developers are actively involved in the crypto space, working on open-source blockchain protocols like Ethereum and contributing to developing decentralized applications.\nIndian Developers are also participating in blockchain and cryptocurrency-focused hackathons in India, which offer opportunities for developers to collaborate and develop innovative blockchain-based solutions. Moreover, there is also a growing interest in DeFi applications and blockchain-focused hackathons in India. Despite concerns about regulation and potential risks, the Indian crypto community continues to grow and innovate.\nWith The Graph, developers in India can leverage a powerful indexing technology to build their decentralized applications and query networks with ease. By establishing a strong Indian community around The Graph, we can facilitate the exchange of knowledge and support, and drive the development of a thriving web3 ecosystem in India. Moreover, the tools and resources of The Graph can empower Indian developers to bring their ideas to life and contribute to the growth and evolution of the decentralized web.\nI have read and agree to the privacy policy:\ntrue\nIf available, please enter a link to your project below:\nLinktree\nthegraphindia | Twitter | Linktree 18\nLinktree.

One of our most notable achievements was working with Near Protocol, where we successfully ran their Ambassador program. This program involved building and growing a strong community of Near Protocol users and enthusiasts through a series of offline events across multiple cities in India.\nTo achieve this, we organized various events, including local meetups and web3 events, which helped us to attract and engage with a diverse range of people interested in Near Protocol. We put a lot of effort into making sure our events were inclusive, informative, and engaging, which helped us to build trust and establish a strong sense of community within the Near ecosystem.\nThrough our efforts, we were able to establish a global community of more than 25,000 users, which was a significant accomplishment. Furthermore, we also focused on onboarding developers and technology enthusiasts to the Near Protocol ecosystem, especially through events organized in colleges. By doing so, we were able to contribute to the growth of the Near ecosystem and help foster a culture of innovation and collaboration.\nNow, we are leveraging our expertise and experience to work with Graph Protocol, where we aim to replicate our success in building and growing a strong community. We believe that our experience in organizing events and building communities will be invaluable in helping to attract and engage with a diverse range of users and enthusiasts interested in Graph Protocol. We are excited about the potential of Graph Protocol and look forward to contributing to its growth and success.\nCan you share any information about current/past web3 experience?:\nWe are highly skilled professionals with 2 years of experience in the exciting and rapidly evolving world of web3. During this time, we have had the opportunity to work on a variety of web3 projects, including the Near Protocol.\nAs part of our work on Near Protocol, we were responsible for running the Ambassador program and building the community by organizing offline events in different cities across India. These events ranged from local meetups to web3 events and were designed to bring together developers, tech enthusiasts, and other stakeholders in the web3 ecosystem.\nThanks to our efforts, we were able to build a vibrant global community of over 25k users who were excited about the potential of web3 technology. Our events in colleges and other educational institutions helped to onboard a new generation of developers and other professionals who were eager to learn more about Near and its capabilities.\nNow, we are excited to bring our skills and expertise to the Graph ecosystem, where we will once again work to build a strong community of users and stakeholders. With our experience in running successful events and engaging with diverse audiences, we are confident that we can help to promote the Graph and its potential to transform the web3 landscape.\nWhy are you interested in contributing to The Graph and/or web3?:\nOur plan is to introduce The Graph to the Indian developer community, web3 influencers, and mass audience, in order to educate and increase awareness about the platform’s powerful indexing protocol. As India has one of the highest rates of crypto adoption and development of decentralized APIs, we see enormous potential for organic growth in the country.

We are definitely interested in collaborating with Indian Graph Advocates and building a strong community around The Graph. Our plan is to organize events focused on this exciting protocol and invite Graph Advocates to participate.\nWe are also in contact with other communities such as Aurora Near and Celo, and plan to reach out to Graph Advocates through these connections. By bringing together like-minded individuals, we hope to provide a platform for knowledge sharing and networking.\nWhen organizing these events, we will consider factors such as the location, venue, date, and format. We also want to make sure that the topics covered are insightful and relevant to The Graph community. We appreciate your support and hope that you can join us in this exciting endeavor!\nWe have a full advocates program in place with a lot of translators. Could you provide more details on how the Graph Advocates can contribute to translations and other regional language-related efforts?\nAs Graph Advocates, there are a few ways that they can contribute to translations and other regional language-related efforts:\nTranslate content: Graph Advocates can help translate documentation, blog posts, and other content related to Microsoft Graph into different languages. This could include translating existing content or creating new content in languages other than English.\nProvide feedback: Graph Advocates can provide feedback on translations that have already been done. This can help ensure that the translations are accurate and that the content makes sense in the target language.\nEngage with local communities: Graph Advocates can engage with local communities in their respective regions to understand their needs and requirements. This can help Microsoft Graph better support local languages and cultures.\nCreate localized demos: Graph Advocates can create localized demos that showcase how Microsoft Graph can be used in different regions and languages. This can help make the technology more accessible to non-English speakers.\nOverall, Graph Advocates can play an important role in making Microsoft Graph more accessible to people around the world by contributing to translations and other regional language-related efforts.\nYour proposal includes both online and offline events. Could you provide more details on these events, such as locations, timetable, and the slide deck you plan to use? Additionally, how will you involve Indian Graph Advocates in these events?\nSure, I’d be happy to provide more details on our proposed events.\nOnline Events:\nWe plan to host monthly online events using a third-party platform to attract developers and the web3 community. The exact dates and times for these events will be announced in advance through our social media channels and mailing lists.\nOffline Events:\nWe plan to organize three offline events, two of which will be held in Mumbai and one in Delhi. These events will provide opportunities for developers and the web3 community to network, share knowledge and collaborate on projects related to The Graph protocol. We will announce the exact locations, dates, and timings for these events through our social media channels and mailing lists.\nSlide Deck:\nWe will prepare a slide deck for our online events that will cover the topics we plan to discuss. The slide deck will be made available to attendees before and after the event.\nInvolving Indian Graph Advocates:\nWe plan to involve Indian Graph Advocates in our events in several ways. First, we will invite them to participate in panel discussions and give talks at our events. Second, we will encourage them to share their knowledge and experience with the community by contributing to our blog and social media channels. Finally, we will collaborate with them to organize and promote the events, ensuring that they are well-attended and reach the target audience.\nOverall, our goal is to create a vibrant and engaged community of developers and web3 enthusiasts who are passionate about The Graph protocol and eager to explore its potential. We believe that our events will provide valuable opportunities for learning, networking, and collaboration, and we look forward to welcoming everyone who is interested in graph advocacy to join us.\nIn terms of content marketing, could you clarify what you mean by this and how it will be executed? What platforms will you use to distribute the content, and what topics do you plan to cover?\nHey there, thanks for asking about our content marketing strategy! Essentially, we’re focused on creating valuable and informative content to educate the community about The Graph platform and its products. To do this, we’re planning on hosting an AMA session, Articles and creating a YouTube channel where we’ll post guide videos and other informative content.\nThe AMA session will give community members a chance to ask questions and get answers from experts and members of The Graph team, while the YouTube channel will feature topics such as an introduction to The Graph platform, using The Graph APIs for DeFi Dapps, and guides on various Graph products.\nTo distribute this content, we’ll be using platforms such as social media channels, community forums, and email marketing. Our goal is to establish The Graph as a thought leader in the industry and increase awareness, engagement, and adoption of the platform among developers and users of decentralized applications.\nOverall, we believe that content marketing is a powerful way to build trust, credibility, and authority within the community and help drive the growth of The Graph platform.\nYou mentioned the creation of a separate Telegram community. In my opinion, it might be more beneficial to use the existing AdvocatesDAO Discord to help the community grow in one place and foster collaboration. Could you explain your reasoning for creating a new Telegram community?\nI understand your point of view about using the existing AdvocatesDAO Discord to foster collaboration and community growth. However, I think creating a separate Telegram community can have several benefits as well. For one, Telegram is a widely used messaging app with a large user base, and having a presence on this platform can help us tap into a wider audience. Additionally, separating the community into two platforms can help us create a more focused and organized space for discussions and activities related to giveaways and engagement. This can be especially important for managing and tracking the progress of giveaways and ensuring that participants are actively participating in the community. Lastly, having a separate Telegram community can provide a different atmosphere and user experience compared to Discord, which can be more accessible to some users. Overall, I think creating a separate Telegram community can be a useful addition to the existing Discord community for engaging and growing the AdvocatesDAO community.\nHow do you plan to ensure the sustainability of your community-building efforts beyond the initial three-month period outlined in your proposal?\nThank you for your question! We understand the importance of ensuring the sustainability of our community-building efforts beyond the initial three-month period. To achieve this, we have developed a long-term strategy that includes several key steps.\nFirstly, we plan to evaluate and assess the impact of the program during the initial three-month period, identify the strengths and weaknesses of the program, and develop a plan to address the gaps.\nSecondly, we will build a core team of volunteers who are committed to the cause and have the necessary skills to run the program. This team will be responsible for driving the community-building efforts and ensuring that the program runs smoothly.\nThirdly, we will develop a communication plan to keep the community engaged and informed. This plan will include regular updates on the progress of the program, upcoming events, and opportunities for involvement.\nFourthly, we will establish partnerships with other organizations that share similar goals and values. These partnerships can provide additional resources and support to help sustain the program.\nLastly, we will seek funding opportunities to support the program’s ongoing efforts. This could include grants, sponsorships, or crowdfunding campaigns.\nIn terms of continuous support from Graph, we plan to maintain open communication and build a strong relationship with the company. We will provide regular updates on the program’s progress and discuss any challenges or needs. Additionally, we will highlight the positive impact that the program is having on the community to demonstrate the value of continued support. We believe that by following this long-term strategy, we can ensure the sustainability of our community-building efforts beyond the initial three-month period.\nCan you share some examples of the types of YouTube videos you plan to create, and how they will support your overall mission of educating and onboarding the Indian community?\nWe have already created a youtube video for Nearby the name of TalksOnNear, we are happy to provide you with the link as well.\nTalks on Near Blockchain - YouTube 1\nWould you be able to provide us with a connection at NEAR that could speak on your role there? Would you ask them to comment on this thread?\nYes, Her name is Priyanka and also I can share my NEAR Community DAO Member Forum ID',

I’m not technical myself but I will rely mainly on the opinion of my colleagues with a technical background that it is first of all very hard to know which project used The Graph and then maintain and update that list with projects which just started using it along the way. It can be used in a wide range of projects, from really small and private ones to large ones and quite well-known. But I agree that it would be very interesting to be able to see the progress, so I can still be convinced otherwise here if you could explain your plan to retrieve and update this kind of information?\nI also believe that The Graph website provides a lot of high-quality information and resources, and other than that we have a bunch of other projects which aims to gather maybe not all “Graph projects” in one place but all web3 projects. You can check out the website: https://everest.link/ 1 which gathers all web3 projects, or even join the currently ongoing project https://www.geobrowser.io/ 1 which aim is to organize information using the knowledge graphs.\nThe proposal includes also the listing of airdrops which we don’t organize in our community and in a few places there is the name of another project “Axelar” used which gives me a reason to suspect that this proposal wasn’t tailored to The Graph and the community around it. I would also like to bring to your attention that the website for Push Ecosystem contains a few bugs and spelling mistakes, so a good review of it would be needed.',

I appreciate this type of reply that motivates and helps to improve.\n@juliannaMLN I am also going to cover your questions here.\nHow are we going to get projects and their data?\nThe main concern I see most members have is how we will find and add projects on the Ecosystem Website. The source we will use to search which project has partnered with The Graph is Twitter, Telegram, Discord, Forum, and other official platforms. Any project that has partnered or built with The Graph is surely announcing this update on their social media. The Graph website is a place where we can find which project is using The Graph.\nBrainFried:\nCould you please provide more information on how you plan to extract and update this information from both on-chain and off-chain sources? While I think the idea is great, I think the real value-add would be in real-time data aggregation.\nWe are going to use Coinmarketcap, Coingecko, TradingView, and a few other third party APIs to get live data like token price, chart, token details, etc.\nAdding projects on the website will be manual process and semi-automatic with the help of 3rd party APIs.\nThis is the reason why I said that there will be a Website Management cost. I will keep updating the website or projects once or twice in a month and any important updates will get updated immediately.\nThe details that I need to update is; Project description, Category or tags, Banner & Videos, How they are using The Graph\nThe details that will get automatically updated is; Token details, Chart, Exchanges, TVL Marketcap, Social media links, etc.\nOther lists like Exchanges, Swaps & Bridges, Jobs, and Grants will be manually handled.\nBrainFried:\nFinally, considering the scope of work involved, it’s my opinion that the requested budget may not be sufficient to adequately support the efforts required to build and maintain this platform. It would be advisable to reassess the budget based on the complexity of the project and the resources needed to ensure its success.\nAfter reading all suggestions and feedback I also think the budget is not enough to develop an Ecosystem Website in this budget hence, I am going to review my proposal and share updated Milestones here.\nUpdated Milestones & Amount Details\nTimeline: 3-4 months\nExpense Estimate: 7630 USD\nDomain & hosting: 500 USD per year (including domain)\nWeb Development: 4000 USD one time\n3rd Party API: 360+180+450= 990 USD per year\nWebsite management: 120 USD per month (1440 per year)\nResearch of ecosystem projects: 700 USD one time\nTech Stack we will use\nFrontend: React\nAnimation: 3.js & particle.js\nBackend: Django\nDatabase: MySQL\nProject Expenses\nDevelopment and Design $4000\nDomain & Hosting $500\nResearch on Projects $700\nWebsite Management $1,440\n3rd Party API $990\nTOTAL $7,630\n@juliannaMLN\nI am a developer hence it will help me if you have a connection with any project or protocol that needs an Ecosystem Website.\nIt is not hard to know which project is using The Graph, it just needs some analysis, roaming on social media can help you to know which project is integrating or developing what. Above I already explained how I am going to get projects that are using The Graph and how I will update them.\nBy comparing our proposal and the information that The Graph website and other websites that you mentioned provides, you will find there is a huge difference.\nAt first let’s take “https://everest.link/”\nThey have a list of 1500+ projects but which information do they provide? Name, ID, Website, Github, Twitter, and logo. And please check my proposal again to know which information we provide.\nThey do not update anything the data showing is very limited.\nhttps://www.geobrowser.io project is fully different from ours. It is definitely one of the best idea and will be useful for The Graph community to gain knowledge.\nThe Airdrops page is not limited to The Graph, the page will show the airdrops that are from other projects as well which are associated with The Graph). One of the best ways to increase engagement.\nI am sorry that I missed that part, I am a crypto enthusiast and continuously approaching different projects to contribute to their ecosystem. Like The Graph, Axelar is also one of the fastest growing projects hence I pitched them with the same idea but it’s not tailored.\nPush Ecosystem website is still in development and not currently focused on content instead developing them.',

And the most of information will get updated automatically. The information that requires manual update is very rare.

We will explore the method to add new projects automatically. So when we are not here updating the website still new projects will get added to the website.\nAlso if we see other projects ecosystem website like chainlinkecosystem, awesomenear, suiecosystem, etc. They are also doing same but here we have advantage of more data. Plus we are dedicating time to work as website management to keep website clean which our competitors don’t do.\nAfter seeing 5 “No” votes I think it is hard to convince',

             'text_comment': 'Hi @SpicyPunks and rest of the DAO, cc: @doxe01.eth and @pdiomede\nI have some doubts and questions on how the funds were used by you. Here are some of my questions for you @SpicyPunks\nYou said you have organised 5 events so far with 250+ attendees: Where? How many people in each event? How much funds were used for each event and a complete breakdown of every event’s funds used and graph marketing/people onboarded to graph ecosystem?\nThe videos are only 23-52 seconds long with just pictures merged and made into them. A good idea would be to record the whole session of you speaking so that DAO can know what you are speaking about and what was the key takeaway for the attendees?\nFrom the looks of the videos, they look like they were organised in Universities, I have questions on how much funds were used since it doesn’t cost more than $200 to organise at Universities? If it was a city event, how the funds were utilized?\nWas Web3 Sabha being a partner with Graph communicated with the Graph foundation?\nThe media coverage part is something that I am concerned about as well. Both the articles from the Print and Business Standards are exact copy of each other. Pretty much every word is same. What’s more astnoishing is that both of them are published on June 6th, and the biggest concern is that it says " This story is auto-generated from a syndicated feed. ThePrint holds no responsibility for its content." AND “(Disclaimer: The above press release has been provided by SRV Media. ANI will not be responsible in any way for the content of the same)\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)”\nSo this means there were no expenses on the media outlet at least and its not their official news? Here’s what I meant:\nIt’s not clear on how many people/attendees were onboarded to Graph Ecosystem. What are your ideas and thoughts on giving us better stats/numbers?\nLast thing, your website (https://spicypunks.com/ 1) doesn’t mention Graph as their partners either.\nI think these are some real concerns specially the costing.\n-Naruto',

My interest lies only and only in the betterment of GraphDAO and nothing else. Please don’t think I am attacking your work.\ncoming to the point:\nYou didn’t mention where in Ludhiana? What venue? Was it colleges? because it looks like colleges and universities through some pictures. So if these are workshops in the colleges, there shouldn’t be any food cost involved since that’s just a session?\nI still didn’t get answer for the videos. Why do these videos look like a merger of 10 pictures and are only 52 seconds long? Is this where Photography really cost $500? Because i am sure in $500, there can be long videos made and really skilled videographer. However, it doesn’t look like that from your vimeo video.\n" 2. As discussed earlier the attendees were introduced to web3 and graph ecosystem. They were encouraged to explore the graph and learn about it. They will be provided support for their projects on Graph going forward." → Okay, do you have any report on how many people signed up or clicked the links? Or how many people are building on graph? Encouragement to explore is not equal to KPIs being met. The signups, number of clicks, total number of users registered or any kind of real user data is missing here.\nGoodies $500? Can you please show us any pictures distributing those goodies? Generally that’s a great PR move, but I don’t see any such pictures. There are no pictures for the events actually, which raises the question again: $500 for photography?\n“Web3 Sabha is the event name that we organized for Graph.” → So im guessing you made this twitter for graph? https://twitter.com/Web3Sabha ? If you did not, then why does the graph event has the same name and your picture on the pinned post of twitter. If you did make it for graph, why there is no single mention of graph on the twitter page or the spreadsheet linked to twitter page?\nSome screenshots: This event has no mention of graph whatsoever, where is the PR?\nThere is a spreadsheet of events, there is no name of graph. I tried finding with ctrl+f\nI also gave it benefit of doubt and searched all over on twitter but didn’t get any mention of graph event whatsoever.\nSo my question comes again, where is PR ? What kind of PR? Twitter is main source for any web3 publicity and I do not find any posts regarding the events. So the $500 from PR shouldn’t be there until and unless there is enough evidence for those PR. Sending whatsapp texts and discord texts to friends and acquaintance doesn’t cost $500 if that’s one method used. So need more clarification on your Goodies, Photography, PR and Marketing.\nWhat Marketing Materials? Please explain in detail. If you printed banners and standees, they cost 1300 INR, which is equal to $15.78. If you had 5 events and you got 2 for each event, the cost would be $150 at max. But Im guessing you would use the same standee. So what else did you get as marketing material? Please explain.\nFood and drinks: Since they were college events (that’s how they look from pictures, for eg RMIT is a university), it shouldn’t cost for food?\nOne of the condition for the grand was to get “A minimum of 10 new accepted Graph Advocates, who have been inspired to apply to by these events.” there is no report for this and no signups or proofs that they signed up through you. We shouldn’t take any reports regarding this now.\n" 2. This is the press release provided by our PR firm. If you check every press release it has the same end line so there is nothing concerning here." → What PR firm? What did that PR firm do? Submitting one article and autogenerating at multiple website doesn’t cost $500.\n" 2. 250-plus attendees joined these events and were introduced to the Graph ecosystem. We have a project called Pink Paper actively exploring the Graph ecosystem" → This https://twitter.com/Pinkpaperxyz 1? and https://pinkpaper.xyz/? There is no mention of graph tech being used. Please provide any subgraphs or services that were used to build this app. There is no mention of graph usage on twitter either. Also their twitter looks super shady. These are bunch of retweets and comments from random accounts. Looks like these comments and things were bought from somewhere:\nThe pink paper website doesn’t say anywhere that they are using/exploring graph ecosystem\n" Graph as a partner is mentioned on the website, please check." : I am so sorry, but i do not agree with this at all. I took the screenshot of the spicypunks website and it didn’t have any graph picture/logo whatsoever. I am attaching that screenshot with the date for a confirmation, which was June 7th while writing my previous question. But after 6 days, there was a logo. Not sure why and how.\nThere’s also another issue that I caught, and I am not sure how valid it is, but the graph website was revamped 2 months ago. The old website looks like this:\nBut the new website looks like this:\nThere seems a significant time difference. Mostly like you did an event 2-3 months ago, but there are no new events pictures, no longer videos even though we are charged $500. No PR, no Goodies pictures and no marketing pictures or food. There is no solid data to give and prove how the funds were used or if any KPIs were met or if it benefited the foundation. These things really make me concerned on how these operations going on. I have presented all my facts and understanding. If SpicyPunks can present substantial proofs in next 24hrs, that would be great. Otherwise I request the DAO to cancel this grant.\nThank you,\nNaruto',

Initially, I wanted to organize IRL events, especially subgraph development workshops but Pranav(from Edge & Node) has suggested I should only focus on community growth through online events because offline events are too costly and do not add much value. However, I also feel that most offline fail to provide any value to the ecosystem. So there will be no additional ask for funding for activities like meetups, hackathons, and so on.\nI want to build a separate discord server for the Indian community because of the following reasons?\nTelegram is not suitable for running the things like boot camps, even though we can use Zoom\nbut we want to make it more engaging by organizing side events like inviting The Graoh OGs and\nWeb3 OGs to share their experience and learning with the community member.\nIndia is a huge country so having a separate discord server is going to help a lot.',

It may be better to use the same server to ensure consistency and alignment with the larger community.\nI would also suggest breaking down your roadmap into smaller, more manageable pieces to help ensure its successful execution.\nHowever, in this proposal, your proposed deliverables, such as “I am going to spend at least 5-6 hours daily to do community work which is going to create tweets, blog, creating resources to run bootcamp, to run bootcamp and other side events and workshop”, it can be submitted as Proof of Contributions (POCs) and evaluated on a case-by-case basis for appropriate rewards based on the quality of each contribution.',

All of your suggestions and insights are great.\nComing back to your first suggestion, this suggestion seems like a good idea as it would allow other advocates to join, increase the visibility of the boot camp, and potentially benefit other language communities. I have put in a lot of thought about using the AdvoacteDAO discord for the Bootcamp but I am not so confident with it because of the following reasons :\nGiven the diversity of languages and cultures in India, having a separate Discord would allow for the creation of channels in different languages, making it more accessible and inclusive for members who may not be fluent in English or Hindi.\nI do not know how much freedom I will have in GraphAdvocates Discord in organizing events. Along with Bootcamp, we will also organize workshops, and open interviews with web3.0 developers, quizzes, and discussions.\nYes, KPI for follower count is highly ambitious but a famous quote by Michelangelo says, “The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short, but in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark” so I want to have a high aim and second thing is that I know it is achievable.\nI am drafting the Bootcamp schedules and slide decks, and the session will post them in the forum once it is ready.\nI am constantly in touch with many advocates from India, they are definitely part of our plan has expressed their support.',

This will be held in Online Mode where builders will be developing on their ideas. In between, we have talks and sessions by industry experts on Entrepreneurship over the period of one month, mentoring the students on efficiently building out ideas. It would help a lot if there can be a few workshop sessions(online) by Solana guys on building out on Solana.\nOnline Judging: We have seen a great interest from students at IITM BS Program and RV College and we are confident to attract a huge audience for this. Thus, we will need to filter out the best of the ideas for the offline event. After submitting the projects which are built in the building phase, We will be choosing top 30 around for the online pitching event.\nFinale Round: The top 15-20 projects will be invited to showcase their products to judges in-person at RV College Bangalore. In return, they may get funding for their project to keep building it further and cash prizes from our sponsors.\nWe are primarily having two tracks:\nWeb 3.0 Track. - Focused on projects build on blockchain.\nClassic Tech Track. - Focused on non-blockchain projects - Web2 solutions/ Non-software solutions and others.\nI have read and agree to the privacy policy:\ntrue\nDescribe what your project does or is aiming to do in 50 characters or less:\nStart-a-thon is a hackathon that is being organized under the Jamsetji Tata Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship under Nilgiri House, part of IITM BS Program. Students with exciting ideas for changing the world are encouraged to take part in it.\nStart-a-thon will comprise of mentorship sessions from Wadhwani Foundation, followed by the ideation round and building phase to work on their ideas. In the end, the final round will be organized offline at RV College, Bangalore where the participants will be able to showcase their products to potential Angel Investors, which we are in talks of bringing them in.\nIf available, please enter a link to your project below:\nThis link is a Notion Document containing details about the hackathon. We will be hosting our page by the end of this week. Here: Notion – The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases. 2\nHow far along are you?:\nWe are setting up our hackathon page and finalizing details on track prizes for participants. Also, we have booked the university auditoriums for 3rd week of August for hosting the hackathon in-person for the demo-case event.\nWhy did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you’re making?:\nWe wanted to have a comprehensive hackathon hosted. So this is a combined effort of students at IIT Madras BS Student Program students and Startup Ignition Cell-RV College Bangalore.\nWhat’s new about what you’re making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn’t exist yet (or they don’t know about it)?:\nWhat’s your vision for how your project will impact The Graph and/or web3?:\nTo get more builders start building into web3 with exposure to various projects that are available. This is also spread more word about The Graph and value it provides for projects built on blockchain.\nHow will you measure success?:\nWe measure success through:\nThe submissions and quality projects submitted to the hackathon.\nEngagement and ultimate usefulness people feel about the event being held by holding a survey.\nWhat milestones will you achieve in the coming weeks/months, with or without the grant?:\nWe will be going live in the upcoming weeks.\nWe will be hosting online workshops and sessions for builders to help them build their products.\nPlease select who you think will benefit from your project?:\nSubgraph Developers, Other\nHow much funding are you looking for? (USD):\n1200\nProvide a breakdown of your requested funding:\n$500 To the best hack built using The Graph.\n$250 To the second best hack.\n$125, each to the third best hacks.\n$200, for help in hosting the offline event. This includes a demo day. We will need help for catering of food, help in accomodations and posters+banners.\nHave you applied for (or already received) funding from somewhere else?:\nYes\nIf yes, please describe where you’ve received funding from and how much you have, or will, receive:\nWe will be taking help from Devfolio as they have Partner track prizes from Solana, Polygon, Filecoin and Replit.\nCan you share any information about current/past web3 experience?:\nYes. I have been learning and working in Web3 since last two years. Last year, I interned with Solana Labs on building a wallet- Hydra Wallet, to be used primarily for distribution of funds among members of the wallet.\nWhy are you interested in contributing to The Graph and/or web3?:\nI see the value in The Graph. The solution to indexing and everything is much needed which is provided by The Graph. It seems trivial in Web2 but the solutions of querying in Web3 are not much available and I find the value provided to be a great saver. Thus, I got the idea to spread the word about The Graph. Since, we were already thinking of hosting the hackathon, it could be beneficial if we could join the name of The Graph with it.\nAre you applying as a team or individual?:\nTeam\nWhat type of grant are you pursuing?:\nProject (one-off)\nPlease select the category your project best fits into:\nEducation\n\n\n\nPrimary Community Poll\nDo you fundamentally support this grant application, knowing that the final scope and grant amount may differ from the requested proposal?\nYou need to be a member of trust_level_1,trust_level_2,trust_level_3,trust_level_4 to vote in this poll.\nYes\nNo\n4\nvoters\nVotes are public.\nResults will be shown on vote.\n\n\n\nGrant Committee Vote\nDo you recommend this grant to the DAO?\nYou need to be a member of Grant-Committee to vote in this poll.\nYes\nNo\n0\nvoters\nVotes are public.\nShow results',

Since becoming an Advocate, he has been providing community care support on almost a daily basis, actively engaging on various channels of The Graph ecosystem including: The Graph Discord, Graph AdvocatesDAO Discord & Forum, and various Telegram communities.\nChidubem also attends most, if not all, of the public DAO meetings as well as the various Advocates calls. I have witnessed Chidubem taking away important information from the different calls and then using that knowledge to support other Advocates and community members. He has also recently volunteered to contribute to upcoming DAO pages on GitHub in collaboration with @Oliver.\nChidubem has proactively found ways to participate, support, and contribute to our community and has proven to be aligned with the DAO’s mission. His contributions showcase the type of engagement that would benefit the Graph AdvocatesDAO operations and workflows. I hope to see him accepted into the DAO.\n@Chidubem, please confirm via a reply to this post if you would like to accept this nomination as a candidate for Graph AdvocatesDAO membership.',

Please find below my thoughts for your perusal.\nAudio - In the Web3 canvas, audio use cases are progressively getting decentralised.\na) Shift from Spotify/Apple Podcasts/Google Podcasts/Amazon Music to Audius 4 & Fountain 1\nb) Ownership of original Audio content via Lens 6\nAfter producing my SaaS podcast and doing detailed user research amongst Web3 native audiences and stakeholders, we realised that there will be an intersection of the podcasting canvas with the Blockchain and data ecosystem.\nSo our strategy is to first build a media-collaborative along with our Web3 community. 5 where in Season 1, we will have deep-dive conversations with stakeholders in the Blockchain and Data economy. The engagement metrics will be community-owned 8 within the podcast.\nThis is important for Web3 community as the listeners, hosts, stakeholders and guests will play an important role in this participative canvas. It is important for the Graph community as all the protocols and Web3 projects 5 using (or who will use) Graph will be a part of the narrative. We will engage with the protocol founders/senior leaders in our future episodes and seasons.\nWe will curate the episodes where the Defi project/ DAO/ Protocols have a touch-point (use/building) with Graph. So the discussions will naturally revolve around the Graph, the Web3 infra/network services and the Data economy.\nWe will consult with the DAO members while choosing our guests. We want it to be a collaborative project and there is a possibility of some of the members to be co-hosts in the production as well.\nYes. I have listened to both the podcasts in the Graph ecosystem and have taken inspiration from them too. GrtIQ brings in the current members of the Graph ecosystem onto their podcast and the Index Podcast speaks with Industry pioneers and developers behind the Web3 revolution. We’d love to seek guidance from these Wave 1 podcast grantees in terms of their experience within the Graph ecosystem and possibly collaborate with them too.\nWe’d like to have a softer inclusive narrative in our episodes as each podcast is different in it’s treatment.This will also onboard a lot of future projects into the Graph ecosystem. We had interviewed Hats protocol 1 earlier - Grant Proposal: Hats Protocol: DAO-native roles and authorities - #5 by Lorena 3\nWe’d also mint NFTs 1 of our episodes which will be a collaborative effort between hosts and community members and form a community 2 around it.\nThe distribution is paramount. So we are also speaking with podcast networks for partnerships. We will have a Web2 onboarding onto Graph narrative too in our episodes.\nCost breakdown:\nSeason Production (Episodes Curation, research, recording) & Minting of NFTs - $7000\nHiring and management of a permanent Audio editor - $1500\nNew Podcasting gears - $1000\nActivating Community bounties - $500\nThanks again for all your help over the last week in the discord calls! Shout-out to a few of the previous grantees and the current DAO advocates for their suggestions/advice.',

             'text_comment': 'I want to give my thoughts on this because I am actually quite skeptical about this proposal.\nYour SaaS podcast doesn’t seem to have any kind of big viewership, your link is just a self-made website and when I click to the YouTube channel the videos have 50-100 views each max. That doesn’t seem worthy of that much money to me when there are many free podcasts that get as many or more views. What is the relevance of your podcast when something like GRTiQ exists and doesn’t need a grant?\nI don’t see the relevancy of the NFT thing and it has 14 members, meaning you didn’t even give away/sell all of them. That’s a really small project and I feel like anyone could set something like that up and say they did an NFT series.\nI cannot join the clubhouse thing so I can’t comment on that.\nThe blog doesn’t seem to have big readership or be very special either. As far as I can tell it has one single article.\nThen my most skeptical point:\nThe community you say you want to build a media-collaborative with looks like a pyramid scheme scam to me. The people there are rewarded with tokens by having other people join and this project doesn’t seem to have any actual utility behind it. I joined the Discord server and the people in there talk about “going to the moon” and the admins encourage such talk with posts like this:\nThere also doesn’t seem to be any clear explanation of what the project is about, other than something relating to social media, and the Whitepaper for it is “coming soon” with the last update on that being in March this year. That to me reeks of a shady setup.\nIn conclusion I do not see how the idea for this podcast helps the Graph ecosystem or the AdvocatesDAO and it actually seems to me like it could be a negative and toxic influence on us. The Graph is very much not about “going to the moon” and as we all know price talk about the GRT token is strictly forbidden in our communities. People in “to the moon” communities don’t seem like any kind of good fit for what we strive for and want to do. I honestly do not feel at all like this is something we should support.',

                                    'text_comment': 'Hey @259tim - Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts. As DAO-native thinkers, we are all inclusive of everyone’s opinions. Let me first address your scepticism:\nI am not building Phaver 1 but I am aiming to build a community on Lens 3. If you don’t have lens NFT access, you can engage on Phaver to first become Phaver frens to obtain your Lens NFT so that you can participate in Web3 Social.\nThe reason I am focussing on Lens and not on Twitter 1 is because of multiple reasons (e.g. Integrations). You would have built an audience on Twitter but as the Web3 social graph evolves in 2022, you would like to be closer to your quality Web3 native audience.\nI can sense that you haven’t produced a podcast from your pointers. You are right in saying that anyone can produce a free podcast and as audio evangelists, we indeed encourage that. To produce a successful tech podcast with a high-value listenership is a difficult art. I have been podcasting since 2020 after years of tech consulting in multiple geographies, so the value and quality of conversations that we bring into our discussions are a mix of experience, research (knowledge) and humour. Each podcast caters to the host’s persona and listenership.\nAs a Graph delegator, at this point in time, I am new to the network and am learning the Web3 Data ecosystem. So you are right that the NFT project is small. But it has the potential to become large as listeners like you start owning NFTs to be a part of the podcast. The power of Web3 is the power of collective imagination. If you have ideas for Audio NFTs, which I have been researching this year, happy to brainstorm with you in our Discord.\nGRTiQ and the Index Podcast exists since Wave 1 4 and had to start from somewhere. Similarly, we are in our early days (Wave 7) as we started the podcast in April 2022 and have got the structure in place. We haven’t focussed on the Youtube (Video) distribution as yet and are evaluating Lenstube 13.\nWishing you a Happy weekend!',

Listened to stretches of the The Web3 Ocean podcasts and I feel that the quality is very good. The contents go deep and @saas demonstrates a great knowledge of the web3 space along with great moderation skills.\nWhat initially drew my biggest curiosity is that Republic of Ocean seemingly has its brand tied to The Web3 Ocean project, which has also provided $4,000 in funding. The ask for the grant from the Graph AdvocatesDAO is $10,000. It is certainly not uncommon to co-fund grant proposals with other sponsors, but it is more of an exception to do so for a team that has positioned its brand closely with another co-funding project. Also, the ask from the Graph AdvocatesDAO is even higher than the funding received from the brand-aligned project. Would love to hear the thought process behind that. Thanks!',

             'text_comment': 'Hi @Oliver - Thank you for your constructive feedback and also for listening to the episodes. Happy to get on a call with you to share more about the scope and narrative of the project that we are trying to accomplish.\nAfter completing the deliverables of the Initial funding that we received, I researched the success metrics of a Web3 project. Based on our analysis, the budget requirement will be higher (Marketing & Distribution, Community development) in the initial seasons. Also, going forward we’ll clearly call out the sponsors of our episodes in our podcast to have brand consistency.\nSome of our learnings in this space are:\nCommunity development for a Web3 Podcast is a huge task in the initial seasons. The viral loops are multi-channel and to progressively decentralise the podcast production over a few seasons, we need the curation of a listeners/fan(supporter) community for the podcast.\nWeb3 is ever-growing and every protocol/project in this space is a node. The future seems to be multi-chain and interconnected play of multiple nodes. So we don’t want to limit the narrative to a singular node but we want to connect the nodes in the network to shape an inclusive story.\nDAO-specific engagements take a lot of time. As we further decentralise this project, we will have to attract the right co-hosts, marketing experts, editors, researchers, consultants, design experts and advisors.\nWe have a bias towards Audio and Data guilds. These are of interest to me as I see a lot of future use cases converging. I’ll share about these in our call.\nHence we are scouting mission-aligned sponsors in the early days so that we have the right guidance, and network to craft the project. We are testing out this concept with multiple listeners (Web3 VCs, Founders, Protocol advisors et al) to absorb their feedback too.',

You make a good point about what is necessary to produce a podcast and I understand your points about them. I think there could be some merit in the podcast!\nI do however still disagree with your web3 strategy. Sadly Lens is still difficult to become a member of but I think that is exactly why we should currently focus on the (it feels weird to call it that) traditional distribution channels like Twitter and YouTube. To me it doesn’t seem productive to be promoting unaffiliated communities that we have no control over just to get people on Lens and then get them to find content you make! Sadly Web3 is so early that in my opinion we cannot focus on just Web3 related systems yet, and we would be unnecessarily limiting our outreach by doing so.\nThere is potential in a podcast and after listening to some snippets of yours I am more convinced that you are making good content, so I have less reservations about that general idea. Thank you in any case for the levelheaded response, I appreciate learning what you’re thinking and harbor no hard feelings!',

At USP (University of São Paulo) Top University of Latin America. Sao Paulo is the tech hub of LatAm and USP the lead University in Engineering and technology. The event kicks off with two bootcamps, one for developers and one for non-developers, offering expert guidance and support for first-time attendees and advanced workshops for experienced attendees. Web2 devs will learn web3 languages and onboard the space with the best of the assistance, what will make than ready to participate in their first Hackathon. The Hackathon, the event’s main activity, brings together hackers and developers from around the world to collaborate on innovative solutions that address the most pressing SDG challenges. Participants will have the opportunity to work with experienced mentors and other participants to create high-impact projects and compete for prizes. EthereumSP 2023 is an unmissable opportunity for participants to delve into the web3 and create innovative projects with the potential to change the world.\nKevin Jones will be giving one of the Workshops on The Graph (why it’s important and how to build subgraphs for your smart contract).\nThe grants here would be given as bounties for the projects/hackers\nI have read and agree to the privacy policy:\ntrue\nDescribe what your project does or is aiming to do in 50 characters or less:\nEthereum Brasil (EB) is a non profitable project launched at the end of 2021, initially as a Brazilian web3 event planner focusing in the Ethereum ecosystem.

I have experience in blockchain development of 2 years now and I have been in crypto space since 2017.\nHere are some of my constructive criticism on the proposal. Feel free to take in or disregard ant of it. Just looking to help:\nThe Event seems really long. Looks like a 5 hours event for 100 people is too much (as I remember from the presentation). What is Graph and how to deploy should be 1hour max, the Panel talk shouldn’t exceed more than 30 mins because people/students get bored easily (speaking from my personal exp). The networking and food shouldn’t be taking 2h as well, but it’s good to have some fun times.\nPricing: Venue booking in Vadodra doesn’t cost $1200 unless you are choosing a 4star Hotel. Even if some places do charge that much, they generally have the Food and Beverages included which eliminates the $500 charge. But it really depends on what venue and where.\nb. Swags are too much. I know good quality vendors who print tshirts for 500-800INR at max = ~$10. Prices are actually cheaper than this. Stickers cost 2500INR for 200 stickers = ~$30. A tote bag cost close to 700INR = ~$8. Now if we want to give everyone a tshirt or a tote, it takes our cost too much for no reason. IMO, we should only give tshirts to winners of a quiz + team + speakers. Even though swags are a very good attraction, it’s also a resource.\nc. The photographer and videographer can be reduced to a general photography student/intern type of person, which wouldnt cost more than $200 at max. While I understand the need of good pictures and videos, at the end of the day, it is a meetup of only 100 people and not a conference on a bigger scale.\nd. Standees and posters mostly cost $30-50. How many are you planning to have?\ne. Projector, mic, speakers are generally provided by venue but generally cost $100-150, can confirm from someone on this.\nSpeakers: it’s great to have some developers who have built some great apps on Graph. I have some good recommendations as well, will be happy to send.\nThese are just my basic thoughts, I might be completely off the mark, but my experience has been a little different while organising web3 events.',

I will refrain from judging the presentation skills from one interview where I know stress plays a huge role. On the other hand, it is a crucial part of being the event’s host to be able to effectively deliver information, engage the audience, and convey a message with impact. You also admitted a lack of experience in the web3 space and the fact that you’re very new to the Graph ecosystem, which is again essential to engage in conversations and educate attendees.\nI would recommend from my side to focus on some groundwork and learn about the space for example from the perspective of the Graph Advocate first, join the Learning Series, Community Talks and different advocate role chats regularly organized on our Discord server, and connect with more people from communities across India, and why not from other parts of the world, too. This way you will gain more confidence and experience, and you would be able to build a network and name for yourself in the community, which can be later used for organizing meet-ups and events similar, or bigger than this!',

I see the need to organize and form communities from ground zero, taking advantage of those around me interested in forming part of a cutting edge community connected globally. Initially Aid Web3 Formosa will focus on local talent and the capacity to provide training and guidance for future participants while participating in the ecosystem. This training will be based on community guidelines set forth by The Graph and Etherium , focussing on Web3 implementation . Once our local team is qualified to provide in person or online guidance and training we will offer regional candidates the opportunity to partake in our program. These candidates will be a key role in expanding the regional communities as individuals or by forming their own community Web3 centers with our guidance and training.\nOur Aid Web3 Community Center will partake in The Graph and Ethereum ecosystems technical and non technical roles as part of our training program. Host events locally (community center) and abroad (English and Spanish) on a regular basis promoting our mission.\nAid Web3 Formosa will also offer a studio where content promoting our mission will be created and distributed on a regular basis, with emphasis on The Graph ,Ethereum and Web3.\nI have read and agree to the privacy policy:\ntrue\nDescribe what your project does or is aiming to do in 50 characters or less:\nBuild, support and expand a regional Web3 communty\nIf available, please enter a link to your project below:\nAid Web3 Formosa\nHow far along are you?:\nAs i mentioned I am a Graph Advocate and currently partaking in the ecosystem in a non technical form and learning on a daily basis.\nI have property available in the prime downtown Formosa area and I am fluent in Spanish and English.\nWhy did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you’re making?:\nI picked this idea because I feel it has the potential to make the most impact on the region and the Web3 ecosystem. As a bilingual commercial pilot, flight instructor and entrepeneur I understand the need for training done right from ground zero. With a strong community center I feel we can truly provide massive Web3 adoptation.\nWhat’s new about what you’re making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn’t exist yet (or they don’t know about it)?:\nThe novelty comes in the regional organization, focus on growth and expansion. Provide a strong regional partner to participate and introduce locals to the technology with focus on the future adoptation. Hands on guidance and training to add to the online ecosytem already in place.\nLocated on the border with Paraguay we have strategic access in the region.\nWhat’s your vision for how your project will impact The Graph and/or web3?:\nThis project has the potential to exponentially grow the regional capabilities to participate in the Web3 ecosystems. By providing training to individuals and guidance for new community centers the expansion in Spanish speaking countries will thrive.\nHow will you measure success?:\nSuccess will be measured through the ongoing participation of individuals in our community at first and later by regional particepants and the creation of additional regional community centers in Latin America.\nWhat milestones will you achieve in the coming weeks/months, with or without the grant?:\nMy understanding of The Graph ecosystem will get stronger as an advocate. The commercial property for the community center has been acquired.\nPlease select who you think will benefit from your project?:\nCurators, Delegators, Indexers, Subgraph Developers\nHow much funding are you looking for?

                                       'text_comment': 'Hey there! Thanks for submitting this proposal. After reading it, I have a few questions before moving forward with the vote:\nCould you please share your experience in community building, considering that you have submitted this grant proposal as an individual?\nYour budget primarily focuses on venue renovations and resources. Have you developed a roadmap outlining how you will utilize the venue for running Graph-related activities? Could you provide insights into the specific technical and non-technical activities that will be conducted at the venue?\nIn addition to the venue, what approaches or methods do you have in mind to spread awareness and adoption of Graph in your region? How do you plan to interact with people at various locations and events to effectively communicate your plans to them?\nI really like your proposal, and I think you should start building your community right away, perhaps through physical meetups and events (which can also be counted as advocate contributions). In case this proposal doesn’t get recommended to the DAO now, continue focusing on building your community in your region. Later, when you post this proposal with even a small progress, I believe it will definitely get approved!\nWill be waiting for your reply',

As far as building communities I do have experience but in other successful commercial endeavors, for example:\nTango One Flight Academy was a flight school my brother and I opened when we graduated from flight school. It required to build a community of aviators in the Florida Keys and needless to say their are always challenges, especially on an Island with a permanent population of 9000 approx. and a vacation season that brings the population to around 35000+. We opened our doors in the Marathon Airport main terminal and created a place for pilots to hang out and talk airplanes. These aviators provided income in the form of reoccurring training and certification to maintain their FAA compliance. Later we implemented $99 tours and introductory flights to attract tourist and locals to begin flying in the beautiful Fl. Keys weather. Along with 10 to 20 local students we formed a tight community of local and international aviators sharing the same passion.\nAnother example prior to flying would be U.S. One Staffing in Miami Fl. In this endeavor I created a community of unemployed workers that were willing to travel to the Fl. Keys to work but did not have transportation. We started with a minivan and one worker and grew to have 125 employees and several busses providing the tourism industry qualified and reliable staffing that was unable to live in the Keys due to high cost but wanted to take advantage of the great wages.\nAid Web3 Formosa will begin as a place to explore Web3 and the blockchain through The Graph , hosting events for people who have no knowledge to hackathons with the brightest. With my knowledge and translation capacity we can have an open door to anyone willing to learn.\nIn person, recorded and livestream will be a staple of our community center curriculum. A friendly smile to guide and help along the way will always be available and the input of The Graph team is crucial in forming this community.\nAid Web3 Formosa will reach out via social media marketing promoting the opportunity to grow with us as a community member online and locally. I also am committed to traveling all of South America to spread the word and add members to our efforts. These members abroad will have the opportunity to follow online or visit us in Formosa, Argentina to further their learning. In the future, with growth permitting we can provide training, housing and meals in the same building for approx. 20 guest. These guest should have the capacity to open community centers in their region and would count with our complete support and guidance along with hands on experience. Further more such a space would take advantage of the high exchange rates, multiple transportation options and could easily become a viable gateway to major markets in South America.\nIn addition to these resources I would like to create a studio for constant content creation in several formats including a daily or weekly program and as always the star is The Graph, Web3 and Ethereum.\nI hope this answers your questions and shows how passionate I am about our team at The Graph and the work they do. Thank You',

From what has been read I could form a few thoughts that you should understand.\nI’d like to start by saying that the DAO is not in the business of funding technical things, I’ll highlight the ones I meant.\nadmin:\n1 Projector $700\n1 Laptop $1000\n1 Speaker $100\nAC/Heating $1000\nAlso, the proposal itself is quite unusual. You are the actual owner, and you are asking the DAO for funding, basically to repair the building in which you plan to hold The Graph related events in the long run.\nAlas, in that regard, I view this request, not more as for the community, but just funding for your business startup. It’s not really clear how much this kind of funding would benefit the community.\nYou might as well rent a space and rent a laptop and projector and hold an event that involves people. From the above, by both you and me, I would be against this grant, as it currently exists.\nBut I want to add that this is purely my opinion and I don’t want to influence in any way the opinion of other forum members and the DAO, including. Thank you! And I also want to wish you the best of luck in your work as an advocate!',

The community center I envision is open on a regular business schedule (6 days a week) with people there working on The Graph related projects and focusing on adaptation of Web3, The Graph (technical and non technical). Along with these regular community based projects we would be reaching out by traveling to Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia (to name a few) in hopes to create new interests. Offering these new candidates an opportunity for hands on experience with guidance and direction which reduces drop outs while encouraging them to repeat and create in there local communities. I of course am counting on everyone involved at The Graph who wants to visit us and partake to be an integral part of special events which we will make the most of online and in person. This project emphasizes a strong local community presence and a long term commitment which as you mentioned is different but possible because I own it and think it might be a good concept. As far as renting a space, technical things and holding events it is also an option that I would be open to and have considered but thought this was an exciting “out of the box” concept. I am very excited to contribute in some way to this project and look forward to the DAO´s decision whatever it may be. Thank You and best wishes to you as well.',
